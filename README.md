# My personal dotfiles

These files are my personal customization files that I use to personalize my Windows and/or Linux desktop experience.

There is a script `install.sh` that do the initial setup of all tools (**zsh, oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k theme, oh-my-zsh plugins, brew and yadm**), and then applies the YADM at the end, which gets the customizations on your `~/`.

You can run the script directly with the following:

```bash
curl -s -L https://git.io/JWjpB | bash
```
